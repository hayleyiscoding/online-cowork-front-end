                If you earn money online, it means you likely have tasks to
                complete - and you probably wouldn't mind some pocket money to
                fund your business! This is where the lottery comes in. It aims
                to help you with 2 common issues that plague women with online
                businesses - <strong>productivity and funding</strong>. Our
                founder, Hayley, has travelled to many countries and came across
                many women who were trying to make a living online. And so
                Online CoWork was born. (But let's not forget that this is also
                about having a bit of fun and connecting with like-minded people

                be asked to <strong>confirm the transaction</strong>. It costs 1
                MATIC (approx. USD 1) to add one task. But you can see the exact

                . You will also need to pay a 'gas fee' for (automatically) the
                transaction which is usually less than $0.01c. We have created
                this lottery on the Polygon Network as it allows for very cheap
                transaction costs compared to the Ethereum Mainnet.
                <br />
                <br />

                well, and this will also hopefully help to motivate you to get

                <strong>
                  pooled together to create the lottery "winnings"
                </strong>
                . These winnings will be distributed to one random "Online
                CoWorker" every 7 days to provide funding for their online
                business - to pay for things such as website hosting, shopify
                fees, extra product stock, etc. Or alternatively, if the Online
                CoWorker doesn't have an online business, it could be used to
                pay for educational courses for professional/personal
                development - but it's up to you! The money is yours to use for
                anything that would help you to move forwards in your life.

                1) There are many different kinds of crypto wallets - but the
                easiest is <strong>Metamask</strong>. It takes around 2 minutes

                is a great tutorial on how to set it up step-by-step.
                <br />
                <br />
                ** Something important to note about Metamask (and most crypto
                wallets) though is that it is not like a bank that you can call
                if you have a problem. You are{" "}
                <strong>FULLY in charge of the account</strong>. When you create
                your wallet, you will be given a <strong>secret phrase</strong>.
                This secret phrase is like the pin number for your bank account.
                However, if you lose the secret phrase, you will lose access to
                any funds in your Metamask forever. Wallet security is extremely
                important in the blockchain world, so it is important to keep
                your secret phrase safe! Write it on paper, put it in a ziploc
                bag and put it in a safe place - or even put it in a few safe
                places. This secret phrase can be used by anyone to access your
                account - so make sure it is in a place where no-one can use it
                and never share it with anyone online.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you are not comfortable with the idea of looking after your
                secret phrase, we recently learned about a wallet called{" "}

                for connecting your ZenGo wallet to a 'Dapp' (decentralized

                called "Wallet Connect".
                <br />
                <br />
                2) Once you have a Metamask wallet, you would need to make sure
                that you have added the <strong>"Polygon" network</strong> to
                your Metamask. Please see steps{" "}

                <br />
                3) Next, you need to{" "}
                <strong>load your wallet with MATIC coins</strong> in order to
                take part in the lottery - as each task costs 1 MATIC. You can
                do this many ways - through exchanges like Binance or Coinbase -
                or you could buy Matic directly on your{" "}

                for instructions on how to do this.
                <br />
                <br />
                Another great way is that you could use{" "}
                <a

                In order to add MATIC to your Metamask from Moonpay, you will

                regular currency (called 'fiat' - AUD, USD, etc) into crypto.
                And you will be charged again when you convert your crypto back
                to fiat currency. This fee can range from 1 to 3% - please check
                the fees for your personal wallet provider and your bank.

                Added to this, if you are buying cryptocurrency for the first
                time, you will usually be required to verify your identity first
                (for example with MoonPay) - this is for KYC purposes to comply
                with legal regulations. You will usually need to submit a copy
                of your passport/ID.

                We did consider this as an option when creating the platform.
                However, it is impossible for us to know if you actually
                completed your task or not. If all users "complete" their tasks,
                this would mean that there would be no money to giveaway in the
                lottery. Having said this, if you know that you won't be getting
                your money back, this provides extra accountability for you to
                commit to getting your task done. So by participating, you
                benefit in 2 ways - you receive extra accountability to get your
                task done AND you get a lottery ticket for the chance to win

                You can add any business task that you have been procrastinating
                about, or that you just need to do that day! It could be writing
                a blog post, creating your website, emailing 3 clients, creating
                an SEO strategy, making an Instagram post - or even cleaning
                your desk or getting to inbox zero! You could add one task a
                week or you could add 10 tasks a day - it's up you! The more
                tasks you add, the more incentive you'll have to get your tasks
                done, the more chances you'll have of winning the lottery - and
                the higher the lottery prize pool will be! Feel good knowing

                It is a good idea to not use your Metamask wallet while on
                public wifi, don't click on any suspicious links in your emails
                or online and never give your secret phrase to anyone. It is

                your Metamask wallet gets hacked and you lose your money, we
